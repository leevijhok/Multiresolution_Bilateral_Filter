# Multiresolution_Bilateral_Filter
A Multiresolution Bilateral Filter

Based on the paper "Multiresolution Bilateral Filtering for Image Denoising"
by Ming Zhang and Bahadir K. Gunturk.

A denoising filter that is effective against low-resolution noise, while preserving image edges.
Combines bilateral filtering and wavelet thresholding.

Implemented with Python using OpenCV, Skimage, and Pywavelets packages.
